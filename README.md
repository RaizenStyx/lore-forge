## Getting Started

To get a local copy of Lore Forge up and running for development, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18.x or later recommended)
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (v8.x or later) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (v1.x or later)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/lore-forge.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/lore-forge.git)
    cd lore-forge
    ```
    (Replace `your-github-username` and `lore-forge` with your actual GitHub username and repository name)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Lore Forge requires several environment variables for authentication and API access. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project (same level as `package.json`) and populate it as follows:

```dotenv
# .env.local - DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO GIT!

# --- NextAuth.js Configuration (for GitHub OAuth) ---
# Obtain these from your GitHub OAuth App settings (e.g., GitHub Developer Settings -> OAuth Apps)
GITHUB_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=YOUR_RANDOM_STRING_FOR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET # Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a strong key

# --- Google Cloud Vertex AI Configuration (for AI API access) ---
# Your Google Cloud Project ID (e.g., inbound-trilogy-460817-t5)
GCP_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID

# Base64 encoded JSON string of your Google Cloud Service Account Key
# 1. Download the JSON key from GCP Console > IAM & Admin > Service Accounts > Your SA > Keys > Add Key > Create new key > JSON
# 2. Encode its ENTIRE content (including newlines) to Base64.
#    - Linux/macOS: `cat /path/to/your/service-account-key.json | base64`
#    - Online tools can also be used, but be cautious with sensitive data.
GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_BASE64=YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON

# --- App Access Control (For Developer-Only Access to Main Forge) ---
# The GitHub email address authorized to view the main Forge page.
# This MUST be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side access in Navbar.tsx.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZED_FORGE_EMAIL=your_personal_github_email@example.com
```

### Important Notes:

* Security: Never commit your .env.local file to version control. Add it to your .gitignore. For production deployments (e.g., Vercel), set these variables directly in your hosting provider's environment settings.
* GitHub OAuth App: Ensure your GitHub OAuth App's callback URL is correctly configured (e.g., http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github for local dev, and your Vercel URL for production).

---

## Usage
#### Running Locally
To run the development server:
```dotenv
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### The Test Forge (Demo)

The Test Forge is designed to give you a full demonstration of Lore Forge's capabilities without needing live API calls.

* **Access:** Navigate to the "Test Forge" link in the navigation menu or visit /test-forge directly.
* **Interaction:** Generate lore tailored to specific genres:
    * General, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Cyberpunk, Historical, Horror.
    * The prompt input area is disabled, as its purpose is to display the content of pre-generated prompts.
    * Use the "Filter by Lore Type" and "Filter by Genre" dropdowns to narrow down the list of available test prompts below.
    * Click on any of the displayed prompt buttons (e.g., "The Wandering Blade of the Wastes") to immediately load its corresponding generated lore, prompt details, and title into the Lore Result section on the right.
* **Purpose**: This page showcases the quality and variety of lore Lore Forge can produce, serving as a comprehensive demo.
* **Lore Forge** Explore the app's capabilities with a curated collection of 25+ high-quality pre-generated lore examples.

* **Content Management:**
    * **Copy to Clipboard:** Instantly copy generated lore for use in your documents or game engines.
    * **Save as .TXT:** Download lore directly as a text file for easy archiving.
    * **Prompt & Response Display:** See your original prompt alongside the AI's output for context and easy review.
* **Responsive Navigation:** A sleek, desktop navigation menu seamlessly transitions into a functional mobile side drawer (hamburger menu) for on-the-go access.
* **Secure Authentication:** Utilizes GitHub OAuth for user login and currently employs restricted access control, allowing only a designated developer to access the main AI generation features.
* **Custom Scrollbars:** Unique, themed scrollbars enhance the desktop aesthetic.

### The Main Forge

* **Access"** Only users who log in with the GitHub account email specified in NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZED_FORGE_EMAIL will be able to access this page.

## Roadmap & Future Plans
Lore Forge is an ambitious project with exciting plans for the future:

* **Public Beta/Launch:** Opening the full AI generation capabilities to a wider audience.

* **Collaborative Features:** Implement team accounts and shared workspaces for streamlined lore development among multiple contributors.
* **Advanced Export Options:** Develop integrations for direct export into popular game development tools (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine) or standardized documentation formats (e.g., JSON, YAML).
* **Interactive Lore Visualizations:** Explore generating interactive lore maps, character relationship diagrams, or timeline visualizations.
* **Monetization/Tiered Access:** Introduce premium features or higher usage quotas for advanced users.
