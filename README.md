## Getting Started

To get a local copy of Lore Forge up and running for development, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18.x or later recommended)
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (v8.x or later) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (v1.x or later)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RaizenStyx/lore-forge.git
    cd lore-forge
    ```
    (Replace `your-github-username` and `lore-forge` with your actual GitHub username and repository name)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Lore Forge requires several environment variables for authentication and API access. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project (same level as `package.json`) and populate it as follows:

```dotenv
# .env.local - DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO GIT!
# Obtain from OpenAI developers platform
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Important Notes:

* Security: Never commit your .env.local file to version control. Add it to your .gitignore. For production deployments (e.g., Vercel), set these variables directly in your hosting provider's environment settings.

---

## Usage
#### Running Locally
To run the development server:
```dotenv
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
